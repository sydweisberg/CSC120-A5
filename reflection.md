I started this project off by working with Molly to create our Pants, Pumpkin, and Shirt classes. We knew that these three would be the easiest, and completed them without any bugs or issues. Our first issue we ran into was when we worked on our boot class. At first, we weren't sure how we should print out the boots, since we were a little bit confused by the assignment's directions. We ended up working through that, and figuring out that we just needed to print out the left, right, or both boots, and that we didn't need to worry about the actual execution of which boot to print out. My biggest issue was that I was not exactly sure how storage in the args[] array worked with the command line. Thankfully, with some trusty help from you (Jordan), I was able to figure out my errors. I think I understand how association works from a definition level, but I found it a bit difficult to understand association in the context of this problem. I'm guessing that the Scarecrow object has a Pumpkin, Shirt, Boot, Banner, and Pants, but I am not 100% sure. The only advice I would give to someone in the future is just an example of how to get and store information from the command line.
